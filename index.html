<h3>Heroners</h3>

<p>The Wingra Heron Hops and Derailleur Society is a gentle-persons'
  club of cyclists. We proudly sponsor regular weekday rides starting
  early and returning by 7 AM or 7:30 AM.  At 5:30 AM on Tuesday,
  Thursday and Friday we ride from the buffalo, WEOTA and buffalo again
  respectively (see meeting points below).  On Monday we depart from
  EEOTA at 6 AM.  All rides leave promptly at the posted time.  On
  Wednesdays, rides for mountain bikers might get posted from time to
  time.</p>

<p>We will aim to have four regular weekday rides outdoors and 3
  indoors during the winter (subject to sufficient interest).
  Traditionally, outdoor rides begin when the routes are ice-free (or
  ice can be detoured around) and morning temperatures are tolerable
  -- about or ideally above freezing for the hardiest Heroners -- and
  continue as long as fall weather permits. Rides can be entirely
  before sunrise late in the season, so having a good headlight and
  taillight is important.</p>

<p>Rides are often posted to the list individually until a regular
  pattern of riders develop. Once rides have been established, they
  can be assumed to be on if conditions are appropriate. Anyone may
  post ride opportunities to the list, but we ask that members not
  post rides to the list that conflict with the regular morning
  schedule.</p>

<h3><a name="outdoor">Outdoor Rides</a></h3>

<ul>
  <li><b>Mondays</b>: One-Hour Joy Ride, 6 AM @ EEOTA. Get the week
off to a good start with a not-too-hilly, not-too-hard ride to the
east side of Verona via the Cannonball Path, Seminole Highway, and
Grandview Rd., back via the Military Ridge State Trail. For the
time-constrained, this ride usually reaches WEOTA before 7 and EEOTA
before 7:10, though determined groups have made it back to EEOTA close
    to the top of the hour.
    <a href="https://ridewithgps.com/routes/27389595"
       target="_blank">ROUTE</a></li>

<li><b>Tuesdays</b>: Buffaloes Ride, 5:30 AM @ the Buffaloes. After a
quick warmup on the Southwest Path and Hammersley Road, the ride
passes through Elver Park to rolling hills on Mid Town Road. After a
loop passing by the Riley Tavern via Timber Lane, Paulson Road, County
Hwy J, and Maurer Road, we ride the Mid Town hills in reverse back
into town. <a href="https://ridewithgps.com/routes/32091862"
target="_blank">ROUTE</a></li>

  <li><b>Wednesdays</b>: <a href="#mountain">Dirty Wednesday Mountain
  Biking</a>, starts at various times and locations.  Watch the email
  for announcements.</li>

<li><b>Thursdays</b>: Extended Paoli. 5:30 AM @ WEOTA. This ride is a
version of the classic Paoli loop. "Extended" means we ride the length
of Sun Valley Parkway west to east from Paoli. The non-extended loop
returns to the Badger State Trail via Sayles Trail for a few minutes'
time savings in the event of unforeseen delays early in the ride or
other
exigencies. <a href="http://www.mapmyride.com/routes/view/703255675"
target="_blank">ROUTE</a></li>

<li><b>Fridays</b>: Pathology/Friday Small Ring Ride, 5:30 AM @ the
Buffaloes. Spin a low-stress mostly-path route for a social
ride/leg-opener for the weekend's activities. If you are new to the
group and are not sure if you're ready to hang with the Tuesday or
Thursday rides, or want to work on your group riding skills, this ride
features a more moderate pace. Stronger riders are encouraged to keep
their drive trains on the small ring and pull the group along.
  <a href="https://ridewithgps.com/routes/47431013"

<li><b>Saturdays</b>: The Saturday ride varies from week to week.
  Subscribe to the email list to be notified of when the ride departs,
  from where and what route it takes.

</ul>

<p>Our outdoor road rides average between 16 and 20 MPH.  The best way
  to start with the group is on a Monday or a Friday ride.  These
  rides are flat and easier than the Tuesday and Thursday rides.
  Tuesday is our hilly ride and typically features vigorous moments.
  Try the Thursday ride before the Tuesday ride if you have any
  doubts.  Our group consists of good non-racers, retired racers and a
  few bike racers.  Some of us learned the ropes and developed the
  skills to ride in a group by doing these rides.  We enjoy the
  opportunity to pay back the favor by bringing interested riders into
  the fold.  See links to <a href="#starts">starting point locations</a>.
</p>

<h3><a name="mountain">Mountain Biking</a></h3>

<p><u>Dirty Wednesday (usually runs May to mid-August)</u><br>

  Look for notices Sunday-Tuesday during the summer for morning
  mountain bike rides.  We sometimes focus on skills but one is always
  welcome to come, ride and do their own thing.  Depending on the
  ride, we'll meet at the Buffalo or the east entrance to Quarry Park
  (near Whole Foods).  The meeting time can also vary depending on the
  timing of Sunrise and other factors.  All abilities are welcome with
  the understanding that <b>everyone rides only the sections and
  features they themselves deem appropriate for their ability</b>.
  This ride is weather dependent so check riding conditions
  at <a target="_blank"
  href="http://www.madcitydirt.com/index.php?action=trailconditions">madcitydirt.com</a>
  before heading out.  See links to the <a href="#starts">starting
  point locations</a> below.</p>

<h3><a name="other">Other Rides, evenings and Saturday</a></h3>

<p><u>Wednesday</u><br>

  WNBR: Rides depart from various points in and around Dane
  County every Wednesday.  Ride schedule can be found
  here: <a href="http://wnbr.org/">wnbr.org</a></p>

  <p><u>Thursday</u><br>

    SlownGo: Slow n Go rides are a relaxed pace group ride intended to
    make it easy for everyone to participate without getting dropped
    and allow stronger riders to get in some easy miles before the
    weekend.  The aim is to hold a steady comfortable effort, ie soft
    pedal up the hills.  Subscribe to the email list to get time and
    meeting location.</p>

  <p><u>Saturday</u><br>

    Saturday rides are generally posted to the group email list.</p>

<h3><a name="indoor">Indoor Rides</a></h3>
